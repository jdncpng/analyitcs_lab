# Introduction
Businesses are all about efficiency and saving costs. Even with the rise of AI, we are still
dependent on human capital for running business operations. Unlike a machine, humans are
prone to accidents, sickness and circumstances out of their control, leading them to be
absent in the workplace. Hours not worked equates to loss of productivity and opportunity to
generate profits. If only companies could predict the number of hours workers will be absent,
they could probably estimate loss in advance, and find ways to compensate for it.
We would explore if certain features could predict the number of hours a worker would be
absent.

# Understanding the data
My chosen dataset is publicly available in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
(archive.ics.uci.edu).
Records of absenteeism were sourced from a courier company in Brazil, within a time period
of July 2007 to July 2010 (3 years). It was used in academic research at the Universidade
Nove de Julho, Postgraduate Program in Informatics and Knowledge Management.
